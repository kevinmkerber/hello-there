can I pull this?

I sure can, and now I'll just push it back  to github

Changed again! WTF?


Hmm, didn't seem to work in terms of "git pull" lets try again

git pull brought in changes, but git status showed no changes, maybe this will work?

we are going to try to stage and unstage a change with git

one more thing

here I'm going to try git diff
